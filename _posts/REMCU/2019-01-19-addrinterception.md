My old research paper that I conducted long time ago on the topic of peripheral forwarding using Dynamic Binary Instrumentation (DBI).

While the example may be absent, the repository serves as a comprehensive resource for anyone seeking to gain a deeper understanding of peripheral forwarding using DBI.
