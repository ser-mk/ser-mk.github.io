description: Modifications to the Delta compression algorithm that have resulted in an improvement of up to 50% in compression ratio for some datasets
---

I have recently been experimenting with GPU acceleration using [NvComp](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvcomp) library and its implementation of Delta compression algorithm for integer sequences. The Delta compression algorithm is a widely used technique for compressing time-series data, but I have found that it can be improved upon, particularly in terms of the compression ratio.

After careful consideration and analysis, I have made modifications to the Delta compression algorithm that have resulted in an improvement of up to 50% in compression ratio for some datasets. This improvement was achieved by taking into account the maximum and minimum values on the interval and coding them accordingly.

I would like to share them with the open-source community.
